title: What’s WordNet?
description: What is WordNet?

To inject knowledge of the meaning of English words into a software application, there is no algorithm but a dictionary. (Or [embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)!) Words are used to describe and define one another; there are complex relationships among words that we, as humans, take for granted. WordNet encodes the fundamental building blocks of English in a machine readable form.

[WordNet®](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) was developed under the direction of Dr. George A. Miller at Princeton University, and is graciously offered with a [commercial-friendly license](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/license-and-commercial-use).
