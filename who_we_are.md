The first version of Yawni was created by [Oliver Steele](https://www.osteele.com/) in 2001 ([!](https://web.archive.org/web/20011221083224/http://jwn.sourceforge.net/)). Large portions of the original software were re-written by [Luke Nezda](https://github.com/nezda); the initial part of this renewed development effort was sponsored by [Language Computer Corporation](http://www.languagecomputer.com/).
