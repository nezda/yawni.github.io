* Comprehensive keyboard navigation ⌨ 🧭, including Undo ↩ / Redo ↪ for typing (⇧ Z / ⇧ ⌘ Z), standard control-to-control navigation with the ↹ (Tab) key, font zooming (⌘ = / ⌘ -), and multi-window 🪟🪟 support (⌘ N)
* Runs on macOS 🍎, Linux 🐧, and Windows; once installed, does not even require internet access 🚫 🌏! <span class="text-muted">(since all the data is all embedded in the application's “jar file”)</span>
